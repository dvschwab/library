This repo is a simple, console based library application developed in C#. It establishes a class model with Library, Book, and Patron classes, the appropriate interfaces, and some basic behavior to simulate
the process of borrowing and returning books from a library. The user interacts with the application the same way that, in Olden Tymes, a user would use Telnet or another protocol from their home computer to
search the catalog. The project is a learning exercise that my friend and I developed together to enhance our understanding of C# and the github workflow.

It should go without saying that there is no warranty whatsoever with this code, or even a basic expectation that it will run at all or install the classic Stoned virus--kidding: unless you are running an
honest-to-god DOS machine, or possibly Windows 95, there is no way a boot sector virus is going to do anything.

If you like this little application, feel free to use it for non-commercial purposes, as set out in the license. Yeah, I'm that guy. Leave the FOSS up to the Big Five.
